# DeepFake Detection and Prevention: A Comprehensive AI Approach

## Introduction
Welcome to the **DeepFake Detection and Prevention** project!  

This project leverages advanced AI and machine learning techniques to detect and prevent deepfake images and videos. By utilizing neural networks and state-of-the-art algorithms, it identifies manipulated media and mitigates its impact.  

Whether you are a researcher, developer, or AI enthusiast, this project provides:  
- Comprehensive documentation  
- Clean, modular code  
- Pretrained models and datasets for experimentation  

This repository is a step towards combating digital misinformation with AI.
